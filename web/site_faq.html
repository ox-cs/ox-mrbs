    <h4>Why can't I delete/alter a meeting?</h4>
    <p>
      In order to delete or alter a meeting, you must be logged in as an administrator.
	  
      If you would like to make room bookings then you should contact <a href="mailto:rooms@your.place">rooms@your.place</a>.

    <p>
      Clicking on the desired time brings you into the booking screen.
      Select the appropriate <dfn>Repeat Type</dfn>. The room will be scheduled
      at the same time, until the <dfn>Repeat End Date</dfn>, on the days
      determined by the Repeat Type.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A <dfn>Daily</dfn> repeat schedules every day.
      </li>
      <li>
        A <dfn>Weekly</dfn> repeat schedules those days of the week that you
        check under <dfn>Repeat Day</dfn>. For example, use Weekly repeat
        to schedule the room every Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday; check
        those days under Repeat Day. If you check no days under Repeat Day,
        the schedule will repeat on the same day of each week as the first
        scheduled day.
      </li>
      <li>
        An <dfn>N_Weekly</dfn> repeat is the same as a Weekly repeat, except
        that the bookings are only made for every Nth week where N is 
        entered under <dfn>Number of Weeks</dfn>.   For example, to make
        a booking for every other week, use 2 for the number of weeks.
      </li>
      <li>
        A <dfn>Monthly</dfn> repeat schedules the same day of each month,
        for example the 15th of the month.  If you select the 29th, 30th
        or 31st of the month, then for a month where that day does not
        exist the last day of that month will be used instead.
      </li>
      <li>
        A <dfn>Yearly</dfn> repeat schedules the same month and day of the month,
        for example every March 15th.   If you select the 29th February, then
        for those years where that date does not exist the 28th February will
        be used instead.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally, a <dfn>Monthly, corresponding day</dfn> repeat schedules one day
        each month, the same weekday and ordinal position within the month.
        Use this repeat type to schedule the first Monday, second Tuesday,
        or fourth Friday of each month, for example.  If you have selected the 29th, 30th
        or 31st of the month, i.e. the fifth weekday of a month, then for those 
        months where there is no corresponding fifth day, the fourth day will 
        be used instead.  (This is a useful way of booking the last weekday in
        every month).

    <h4>How do I schedule rooms at different sites?</h4>
    <p>
      You don't.  Presently the system cannot book two different rooms simultaneously.
      You must schedule each one separately.  Make sure that the time you want
      is available at both sites before making a booking.

  <div id="multiple_users">
    <h4>What happens if multiple people schedule the same meeting?</h4>
    <p>
      The short answer is: The first person to click on
      the <dfn>Submit</dfn> button wins.
      Behind the scenes, the system is using a proper multi-user, multi-threaded
      relational database than can handle many thousands of simultaneous users.
